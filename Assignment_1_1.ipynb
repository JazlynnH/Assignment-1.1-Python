# 2. Unpack the tuple person into three separate variables: name, age, and profession.

# Tuple with person information
person = ("Adam Smith", 35, "Software Engineer")

# Unpacking the tuple into separate variables
name, age, profession = person

# Print the results

# 3. Create a list squares that contains the squares of all the even numbers in the range 1 to 20 (inclusive).

# 4. Write a function to group a list of integers into two lists: one containing even numbers and the other containing odd numbers.

# Print the results

# 5. Create a new list full_names that contains the full names by concatenating the corresponding elements from first_name and last_name.

# Lists of first and last names
first_name = ["Adam", "Jane", "Bob"]
last_name = ["Johnson", "Smith", "Jones"]
